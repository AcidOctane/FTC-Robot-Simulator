# Team 4654: The Jellyfish's Tele-Op Mode Simulator
The following program allows FTC teams to plug their op-modes in and check how they perform in a virtual envrionment with a virtual robot, allowing them to code and debug errors without utilizing their robot!

To use this: Place your op-mode in com.qualcomm.ftcrobotcontroller.opmodes, and then change the initialization of opMode in Simulator.java.

Do note: This program runs as if it were connected to the robot, so to drive, please plug your two gamepads into the computer it is running on.
